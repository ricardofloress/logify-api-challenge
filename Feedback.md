Made a new container for the app and correct the dockerfile

I solved the GRPC problem by correcting the url connection because of the port inside of the docker network

Added the curls of the tests that i thought that were necessary

Because I only had a couple of hours to complete this challenge i only made 3 tests to a method but that should be enough for you to know how i would cover a simple test 

Because of the time I did not had the opportunity to cover all possible ways that the code could throw something wrong

I did not had time to make the redis cache work but i made a method inside movie service for you to see more or less how i would implement it
